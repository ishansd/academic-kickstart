abstract = "Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs), are a form of unsupervised machine learning, utilizing competitive neural networks, which can synthesize realistic images unique from training data. GANs can theoretically allow a near limitless supply of unique and HIPAA compliant cases, which could be used for both computer and human training. The purpose of this study was to determine if chest radiographs synthesized from a GAN could fool radiologists."
